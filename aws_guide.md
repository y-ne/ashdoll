aws had this user-role management called IAM (Identity and Access Management).

it's not recommended to generate an access_key with root.

creating IAM User

Username > Security credentials > Access Management

for now, just create groups and users that had full access to the console and permission.

just follow the user creation and sign in.

then create access_key for AWS CLI

save the access_key, and then input it to `aws configure`
